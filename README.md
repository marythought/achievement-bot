This is a Twitter bot that celebrates achievements, conceived by Mary Dickson at [@unlockachievemt](http://www.twitter.com/unlockachievemt). It borrows [#ExampleBot JavaScript code](https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot) and retweets the latest tweet using the "#achievementunlocked" hashtag. It attempts to retweet once per hour.

I am attempting to deploy the bot using Heroku, Node.js, and json from various web sources including:

* http://boodoo.co/bletchley.html
