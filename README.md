This is a Twitter bot that celebrates achievements, concieved by Mary Dickson at @unlockachievemt. It borrows #ExampleBot JavaScript code from https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot and retweets the latest tweet using the "#achievementunlocked" hashtag. It attempts to retweet once per hour.

I am attempting to deploy the bot using Heroku, Node.js, and json from various web sources including:
